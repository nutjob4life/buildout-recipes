This project collects, develops, and maintains **recipes** that work with [Buildout](http://www.buildout.org/).

## What Is Buildout? ##

Buildout is a high-level, coarse grained software assembly and deployment system. It's an "exceedingly civilized way to develop an app" according to Jacob Kaplan-Moss. But it's also fantastic for deploying full systems in a repeatable fashion.

Buildout is driven by _recipes_ that give it the ability to do things. This project's goal is to provide a hosting, development, and support platform for various Buildout recipes.
